# Binary-Search-Tree
This is an implementation of a binary search tree in java, with functionality to add keys through a file and through the console. We can also remove keys, search for keys through pattern matching and balance the tree through the Day Stout-Warren algorithm, which does the balancing periodically (not every time a key is inserted) so that the cost is amortized for all insertions and removals

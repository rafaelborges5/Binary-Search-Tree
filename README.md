# Binary-Search-Tree
This is an implementation of a binary search tree in java, with functionality to
add keys through a file and through the console. It is also possible to 
remove keys, search for keys through pattern matching and balance the
tree through the Day Stout-Warren algorithm, which does the balancing
on-demand (not every time a key is inserted) so that the cost is
amortized for all operations.
